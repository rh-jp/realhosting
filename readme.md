The Realhosting Migration tool is a tool based on the Laravel Framework. It helps system managers to keep track of the executed migrations to other servers. This tool is partly based on Crudbooster.com 

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
